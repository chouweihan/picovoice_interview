## Pytorch redesign
My redesign focused on 2 points.
Making the options look more uniform, and making the options into dropdown instead of buttons.
This is a better design because it will scale better into the future. If more and more options are added, 
having more buttons is unrealistic.


## Google widget redesign
The same concept applies here. With focus on "7-20" languages (and possibly more),
It is better to use drop down.

I have implemented 2 ways, one is a simple dropdown list with the languages sorted alphabetically.
The second is a typeahead functionality in which user can search for the language they wish to use.
